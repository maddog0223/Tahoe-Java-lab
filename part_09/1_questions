1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?

//byte stream is reading 8 bits at a time, and is used to read binary(input and output)
//character streams are 16 bits at a time reading universal code and characters (reader and writer)


2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
- buffered input/output stream
- file input/output stream
- data input/output stream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?

-File reader/writer stream
-Buffer reader/writer
- String Reader/Writer

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?

//a code in the try () so it is easier for the coders to start and close the data

// you don't have to to wrap try and catch from the buffer and file reader

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

//try(FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(args[0]); BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader)){}

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?

//An input stream and returns int value


7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)

/**
 * A <code>FileInputStream</code> obtains input bytes
 * from a file in a file system. What files
 * are  available depends on the host environment.
 *
 * <p><code>FileInputStream</code> is meant for reading streams of raw bytes
 * such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using
 * <code>FileReader</code>.

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?

//bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?

//Reads word by word or line by line
//reads words or lines of file reader

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?

//InputStreamReader wraps around the data and reads byte by byte
// BufferReader will be unable to read the data without InputStream, because it wraps around the InputStream, and
not the data.

11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument? **

//


12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?

//read() -- reads word by word

//readLine() reads line by line

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt" **
