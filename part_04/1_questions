Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

A collection of elements of the same type

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?

2d arrays that has a row and a column.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

int[][] scores= new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

String dogs[11] = 10;

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

When the index of the array is not determined(does not exist)

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.

array[i-1];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

unlimited

9) What is a bubble sort?

A way to sort numbers

10) How does a bubble sort work?

For an example, if you have a length of 5 list of arrays, then the indexes that are next to each other will
switch depending on how you want the rows to be set up.

This will be going on a loop at least -1 of the total length.

1,5,3,4

if you want the rows to go from the lowest to the highest (1,3,4,5), and of you are starting from the left, the indexes of the value 3 and
4 will be first compared. 4 is bigger than 3 so no changes will be made. Next 3 and 5 will be checked. 5 is greater than 3 so they
will be switch. Now it would be 3 and 1 that will be compared, because prviously 3 and 5 were switch.
1 is less then 3 so it not be switched. That was one loop. this will AT least be passed over 3 times.


11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

When not all columns are the same length in multi dimensional arrays.

Ex:
int [][] irregular= {{1,2,3},{3,4,5,6,7},{4,4}};

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

int[] array = new int[4];

int i;
for(i=0;i < array.length; i++){

array[i] =+ i;

System.out.print(array[i]);
}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

int[] unicorn = {1,3,5};
int i =0;
while (i<unicorn.length){
i++;
}
System.out.print(unicorn[i]);

14) What is a queue?

First in first out stack

arrays

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?

16) What is a stack?

First in Last out

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

stack is first in last out
queues are first in first out

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

when you are dealing with collections
such as arrays

when you deal with collectives (arrays)


19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

21) What is a String?

A sequence of characters

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

inside the main method

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
