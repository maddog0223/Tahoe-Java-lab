1) What is Java inheritance?

//a parent child relationship between classes
//when a class extends another class

2) How does inheritance work?

//A class becomes a subclass of another class
//by using "extends"

//Ex) class Pencil extends class Utensil {}

// now the Pencil class is the subclass (the child class) of class Utensil

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?

// Reuse-ability is an advantage of inheritance

4) What does the "super" keyword do?

//calls the parent class

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?

//super class constructers are called first

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?

//The subclass takes the same exact method and parameter from the super class to change the brehavior of its body

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?

//poly means multi morphism means behavior.
//^^ Changing the behavior
//Override changes the behavior of the method

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?

//Overloading is copying the same method signature within the same class but has different parameters

//ovveriding is a subclass coping the same exact method signature and the parameter from the super class
//(usually overridden to change the behavior of body)

9) What is dynamic method dispatch? **

// Superclass name = new subclass;

^^ This goes into the subclass.

10) What does the "final" keyword do?

//final sets the method or the variable

// you can not change the method or variable that is a final

 //Example you want to final PI, because final does not change

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class? **
